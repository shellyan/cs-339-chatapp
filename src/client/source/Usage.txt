Usage
======

Client app
--------
It provides two ways of chatting, private group chatting and public topic chatting.

- Private group chatting
  - Share your ID with select individuals and enjoy private chat.
- Public topic chatting
  - Broadcast your ID to twitter so others can join you in a public room.
- Save chatting history
  - Save your chat logs to Evernote.

Restful Server
--------------

Our server provides service of posting tweet and delete tweet,  saving chat history on `Evernote <http://evernote.com/>`_
and a generated shared link. It uses `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_ as mainframe and powers
`flask-restful <http://flask-restful.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_ as extension.

**Host server app on heroku**
Simply follow the documentaion on https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python. Make sure you
have virtual environment acitivated.

Generate Sphinx document
---------------
We embedded sphinx documentation in our client app.

**Customized theme**

We used customized theme `Flask <https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sphinx-themes>`_. ::


    This repository contains sphinx styles for Flask and Flask related
    projects.  To use this style in your Sphinx documentation, follow
    this guide:

    1. put this folder as _themes into your docs folder.  Alternatively
       you can also use git submodules to check out the contents there.
    2. add this to your conf.py:

       sys.path.append(os.path.abspath('_themes'))
       html_theme_path = ['_themes']
       html_theme = 'flask'

    The following themes exist:

    - 'flask' - the standard flask documentation theme for large
      projects
    - 'flask_small' - small one-page theme.  Intended to be used by
      very small addon libraries for flask.

    The following options exist for the flask_small theme:

       [options]
       index_logo = ''              filename of a picture in _static
                                    to be used as replacement for the
                                    h1 in the index.rst file.
       index_logo_height = 120px    height of the index logo
       github_fork = ''             repository name on github for the
                                    "fork me" badge

**Github Pages Integration**

In order to put sphinx documentation on `Github Pages <http://pages.github.com/>`_, you need to install
`sphinx-to-github <https://github.com/michaeljones/sphinx-to-github>`_. Basically it renames [_folder name]
to [folder name], because Github Pages ignores [_folder name] by default.

Here is the instruction:

- Create your virtual env ::

    virtualenv venv
- Activate virtual environment ::

    . venv/bin/activate
- Pip install sphinxtogithub ::

    pip install sphinxtogithub
- Add sphinxtogithub to the extensions list in the conf.py file in your Sphinx project ::

    extensions = [ "sphinxtogithub" ]
- Build your sphinx ::

    make html
- Copy the whole [client] folder to any other place. Go to [your_project_folder] ::

    git checkout gh-pages
  Move your copied [client] to the root of [[your_project_folder] ]  ::

    git add .
    git commit -a -m 'update new content'
    git push

- Your page will be availabe at http://[username].github.io/[project_name]
